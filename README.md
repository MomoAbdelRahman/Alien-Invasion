# Simulating a war between alien and earth armies

This project was done for the course CIE 205 Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis which is offered in Zewail City of Science and Tehnology. The purpose of the project was to simulate a war between multiple army 
units on both teams. Each type of army unit had different fighting mechanics, and would target certain units of the other army under certain conditions. The project was done using object oriented programming, and 
implementing multiple data structures such as stack, queue, priority queue, and double-ended queue.
